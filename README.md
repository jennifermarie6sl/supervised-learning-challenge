# supervised-learning-challenge

In this challenge we used data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.  The steps taken are as below:

## Generate Data
We used the data generator ipynb notebook to generate the data for the exercise.

## Preprocessing the Data
Next the data had to be prepocessed to prepare it for the models.  
One of the files from the generator was used for the training set (2019 Loans) and the other file was used as the testing set (2020 loans).  
Categorical data had to be converted to numeric and code had to be used to fill in missing categories in the testing set. 

# Run Models
Predictions were made in the ipynb notebook prior to running the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier on the data after preprocessing but before scaling the data.  The outcome was also noted.

# Scale the Data
Next the data was scaled with a standard scaler to get it ready to re-run under the models (Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier).

# Re-run Models
Predictions were made in the ipynb notebook prior to running the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier on the data after preprocessing but before scaling the data.  The outcome was also noted.

# Final Outcome
The final outcome was that the Logistic Regression model (on the scaled) data ended up with the highest testing score.
